# Python environment

This repository uses Pixi, with its own Python and packages. No system Python is
needed. New projects default to Python 3.14 unless another version is selected.
This project starts from the full COSMOS Python distribution. Additional
project packages belong in pixi.toml. Test changes before sharing them.

## First setup (also for collaborators)

Mac/Linux, from this repository directory:

```sh
bash install.sh
source ./activate.sh
pixi run python --version
pixi run python foo.py
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\install.ps1
. .\activate.ps1
pixi run python --version
pixi run python foo.py
```

Activation makes `pixi` available in this terminal; repeat it in new terminals.
If PowerShell policy blocks dot-sourcing, use an allowed session (for example
launch `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`) subject to organisation policy.
It does not activate Python directly or change your shell profile.

`foo.py` stands for your actual script. Once pytest is added to the environment,
`pixi run pytest` runs the tests. Pixi requires `run`; `pixi python` is not a native
command. To refuse automatic lockfile changes, use `pixi run --locked python foo.py`
and `pixi run --locked pytest`. The `cosmos.sh run` / `cosmos.ps1 run` helpers always
use locked mode. `pixi run` alone can update a stale lockfile.

If the installer used `--files-only`, first run bootstrap and update, as below,
to resolve and install the environment before using `setup`. A custom Python
version does not have a lockfile until this initial update succeeds.

`install.sh` / `install.ps1` installs Pixi and this repository's saved Python
environment in one command. It does not require a separate cosmos-python clone.
Each project's Python and packages are independent of the standalone distribution
in cosmos-python. For older installations without the install script, run
`bootstrap.sh` followed by `cosmos.sh setup` (or their PowerShell equivalents).

## Add requirements and update

Edit `pixi.toml` locally. Under `[dependencies]`, each line describes a conda-forge
package, for example `numpy = "==1.26.4"` for an exact pin. Choose versions suitable
for this project. Python itself is listed there. Put packages unavailable from
conda-forge under `[pypi-dependencies]`, without duplicating the same package in
both sections. Or run `bash cosmos.sh add` (Windows: `cosmos.ps1 add`) for prompts.

After editing:

```sh
bash update.sh
source ./activate.sh
pixi run --locked python your_script.py
```

Windows: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\update.ps1`.
Run the project's tests, then commit the new scripts, ignore rules, this guide,
`pixi.toml`, and `pixi.lock`. Colleagues use `setup` to reproduce the saved versions.
For deliberate upgrades of all packages within the allowed version ranges, use
`bash cosmos.sh upgrade` / `cosmos.ps1 upgrade`.
If you previously set `PIXI_LOCKED=true` in your terminal, unset it before updating
(`unset PIXI_LOCKED` / `Remove-Item Env:PIXI_LOCKED -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`).

Existing requirements files are not imported automatically. Review the project's
requirements and imports yourself. For a packaged project, consider an editable
local dependency under `[pypi-dependencies]`:
`your-package = { path = ".", editable = true }`, using its actual package name.
For an unpackaged project whose scripts cannot import the root package, add
`[activation.env]` and `PYTHONPATH = "$PIXI_PROJECT_ROOT"` to the manifest.

## Sharing and privacy

Each repository has its own manifest and lockfile. Do not commit `.tools/`, `.pixi/`,
or `.cache/`. The setup uses local files and does not upload code to a chat or
create GitHub repositories, commits, or pushes. Installation contacts GitHub and
package servers to download tools and dependencies; it is not offline.
Use your normal local credentials for private dependencies, never tokens embedded
in configuration. Keep private repository manifests and lockfiles private too.
The lockfile supports Apple Silicon/Intel Mac, Windows x64, and Linux x64, but
validate your actual application on each platform you intend to support.

## Keep the setup scripts up to date

See [COSMOS-TOOLS.md](COSMOS-TOOLS.md) for upgrading the helper scripts from a newer
cosmos-python checkout. Commit `.cosmos-python.json` with the scripts so future
updates can detect local modifications. This project guide and the dependency
manifest/lockfile are preserved by helper updates.

## Full distribution baseline

The installer can use `--distribution` (PowerShell: `-Distribution`) to copy
the standalone COSMOS manifest and lockfile. `.cosmos-distribution.json` records
the original dependency constraints and file hashes. It is provenance, not an
automatic dependency updater. Extra packages go in this project's pixi.toml.
Helper updates preserve the baseline record and all project requirements.
To adopt a newer distribution, compare the newer cosmos-python pixi.toml with
this baseline, deliberately merge the desired constraints into this project's
manifest, run update and tests, and commit the reviewed manifest and lockfile.
Never replace a project's lockfile with the standalone lock after adding packages.
